This controversial **race purity test** takes inspiration from the classic Rice Purity Test format but focuses specifically on examining individuals' perspectives on race, politics, and social issues. Unlike traditional personality assessments, the **race purity test** uses a weighted scoring system that evaluates responses based on the severity of racial bias, from mild stereotyping to extreme discriminatory behavior.

The **race purity test** gained massive popularity as millions of users began sharing their results on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and Instagram. What makes this **race purity test** particularly compelling is its direct approach to addressing sensitive topics that many people are curious about but rarely discuss openly. The assessment contains 100 thought-provoking questions that challenge users to honestly evaluate their beliefs, experiences, and behaviors related to race and ethnicity.

## The Science Behind Racial Bias Assessment

Understanding racial bias requires recognizing that it exists on a spectrum, from unconscious microaggressions to overt discriminatory behavior. The **race purity test** is designed to help individuals identify where they fall on this spectrum through a comprehensive self-assessment process. The test's weighted scoring system assigns different point values based on the severity of each behavior or belief, with higher weights given to more serious forms of racial bias.

Research in social psychology has shown that most people harbor some degree of unconscious bias, often without realizing it. The **race purity test** serves as a tool for self-reflection, helping users recognize patterns in their thinking and behavior that might indicate racial prejudice. While the **race purity test** is not a scientifically validated psychological instrument, it provides valuable insights into how individuals perceive and interact with people from different racial and ethnic backgrounds.

The assessment covers various aspects of racial bias, including stereotypes, microaggressions, discriminatory behaviors, and hate speech. By presenting these scenarios in a straightforward manner, the **race purity test** encourages honest self-evaluation and promotes awareness of potentially harmful attitudes and behaviors.

## How the Race Purity Test Scoring System Works

The **race purity test** employs a sophisticated scoring mechanism that differentiates between various levels of racial bias. Each question in the **race purity test** is assigned a weight from 1 to 5, with higher numbers indicating more serious forms of racial prejudice. A weight of 1 represents mild stereotyping or unconscious bias, while a weight of 5 indicates extreme hate speech or behavior.

The final **race purity test** score is calculated as a percentage, with results categorized into different levels: "Libtard" (0-10%), "Unaware bias" (10-20%), "Casual racist" (20-30%), "Defensive racist" (30-40%), "Systematic denier" (40-50%), "Political racist" (50-60%), "Blatant racist" (60-70%), "Militant racist" (70-80%), and "Neo nazi" (80%+). This classification system helps users understand the implications of their **race purity test** results and encourages reflection on their racial attitudes.

The **race purity test** scoring system is designed to be educational rather than punitive, emphasizing that awareness is the first step toward positive change. Users who receive higher scores are encouraged to reflect on their beliefs and behaviors, while those with lower scores are reminded that unconscious bias can still exist even among well-intentioned individuals.
